1) What is Java inheritance?
    Is a property of Java that allows classes to receive the properties of a "parent" class.
    This allows a class to build upon the functionality of another class.
2) How does inheritance work?
    It works by adding the keywork "extends" followed by a class name, when declaring a class
3) What are some advantages that inheritance provides?
    It helps to minimize duplicate code. Allows also to extend the code of an application easily.
4) What does the "super" keyword do?
    It refers to the parent class.
5) In what order are constructors called when there are multiple subclasses?
    First the parent classes followed by the subclasses.
6) What does it mean when a method is overridden?
    It means that it will retain its signature but a new functionality will be given by change the code inside of it.
7) How do overridden methods support polymorphism?
    They support polymorphism by allowing an application to use a function even if it need to be done slightly different
    depending on a certain situation.
8) What is the difference between an overloaded method and an overridden method?
    An overloaded method takes different amount or types of parameters, while the overriden method has
    effectively the same signature with a different code inside of it.
9) What is dynamic method dispatch?
    Is the way Java determines which overriden method will be used at runtime depending on the object that calls the
    the method instead of the type of the reference variable.
10) What does the "final" keyword do?
    If assigned to a variable it stops value change.
    If assigned to a method it cannot be overwrote.
    If assigned to a class it cannot be inherited.
11) Are classes in Java are a subclass of what super class?
    Object
