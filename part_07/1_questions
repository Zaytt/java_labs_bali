    An interface in java is a blueprint of a class. It has static constants and abstract methods.
    The interface in java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction.
6) What makes interfaces unique?
    That they cannot be instantiated, only implemented by other classes.
7) What keyword is used to specify that a class is going to use a separate interface?
    implement
8) What makes interfaces so useful?
    That they help implement abstraction in Java, they create a road map for other classes to follow.
9) What was added in JDK 8 that makes interfaces even more useful?
    default methods.
    These can add a default behavior of a method inside a interface.
10) How many interfaces can a single class implement?
    Multiple
