1) What is the difference between a byte stream and a character stream?
    A stream is a way to sequentially accessing a file.
    A byte stream reads the file byte byte byte while the character stream reads it character by character.


2) List at least 3 examples of byte stream classes?
    BufferedInputStream
    BufferedOutputStream
    ByteArrayInputStream
    ByteArrayOutputStream

3) List at least 3 examples of character stream classes?
    BufferedReader
    BufferedWriter
    FileReader
    FileWriter

4) What is try-with-resources? Why is it super cool?
    try-with-resources allows us to declare streams as parameters in a try-catch block that
    will automatically close when the try-catch finishes.

5) Demonstrate a try-wth-resources block:

    //This try-with-resources uses and closes and SQL statement object

    try (Statement stmt = con.createStatement()) {
        //DO STUFF
    }catch (SQLException e) {
             e.printStack();
    }

6) What does the read() method on the FileInputStream class return?
    An int containing the next byte of data.

7) What does the documentation above of the FileInputStream class header say? (hint: inside /** ... */)
     * A <code>FileInputStream</code> obtains input bytes
     * from a file in a file system. What files
     * are  available depends on the host environment.
     *
     * <p><code>FileInputStream</code> is meant for reading streams of raw bytes
     * such as image data. For reading streams of characters, consider using
     * <code>FileReader</code>.

8) Is a DataOutputStream used for bytes or characters?
    Bytes

9) What is a BufferedReader?
    It's a Buffered input character stream.
    It reads text from a character-input stream, buffering characters so as to
    provide for the efficient reading of characters, arrays, and lines.

10) Why does a BufferedReader require an InputStreamReader as an argument?
     Because InputStreamReader is a bridge from byte streams to character streams: It
     reads bytes and decodes them into characters using a specified charset.

11) What does the InputStreamReader do with it's byte stream argument?
    It decodes it into readable characters.

12) What is the difference between the read() and readLine() on BufferedReader?
    One reads one character and the other reads a whole line of text.
    A line of text is terminated with a carriage return '\n'

13) Demonstrate instantiating a BufferedReader that will read a file called "yucatan_cenotes.txt"
    BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(new File("yucatan_cenotes.txt")));
